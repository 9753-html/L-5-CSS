        <p>A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. Stars are incredibly hot and emit light and heat due to nuclear fusion occurring in their cores. The Sun, our own star, is a typical example. Stars vary in size, temperature, and lifespan, and they play a crucial role in the universe, from forming elements to providing the light and energy that sustains life</p>
